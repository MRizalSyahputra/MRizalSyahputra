## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## i'm currently running at my school account, so this account will be deactivated someday. when that day come, just go to my main account (link later)

## in short, i'm focusing for designing (like UI/UX design) and digital multimedia manipulation rather than coding. but i also has interest at data science (sadly, i'm too lazy to code bruh)
